# Poker Leaderboard App
This is a simple web application designed to help me and my friends track our poker winnings and performance over time.

# Features
## Leaderboard: 
Keeps track of the current rankings, total winnings, games played, and average winnings per game for all the players in my poker group.

## Update Winnings: 
Easily add or subtract winnings for a specific player, and the app will recalculate their statistics accordingly.

## Add New Players: 
If we have a new player joining our poker games, we can add them to the leaderboard with a starting balance of zero.

## Remove Players: 
If someone leaves our poker group, we can remove them from the leaderboard.
